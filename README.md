# ExportNumbersNLetters
Musescore Plugin to export numbers or letters for beginners

I created this plugin to distribute music sheets in form of letters or numbers for my beginner band members.

Options include:

- Use flats or sharp letter descriptions only or choose automatically from the current key signature

# Installation
Install as every other Musescore Plugin.

Additionally, install pandoc and make sure it is executable everywhere (add its install location to the PATH on Windows)
