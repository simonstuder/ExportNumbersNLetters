# ExportNumbersNLetters
Musescore Plugin to export numbers or letters for beginners

I created this plugin to distribute music sheets in form of letters or numbers for my beginner band members.

Options include:

- Use flats or sharp letter descriptions only or choose automatically from the current key signature
